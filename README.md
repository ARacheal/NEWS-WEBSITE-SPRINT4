# Sprint-4---NEWS-WEBSITE
New features have been introduced to our News website, such as a search facility with a textbox for searching on keywords. Our goal is to provide complex search features such as AND, OR, and NOT keywords, as well as parenthesis support.  Sprint 4 testing comprises system testing to check the complete program, as well as a regression test for each test case.
