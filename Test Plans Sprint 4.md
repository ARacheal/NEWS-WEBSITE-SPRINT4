**1.0 Introduction**

Created a news app that obtains news headlines from https://newsapi.org/. The app will display articles from the "General" category when no one is signed into the app. There is a page to sign up, sign in and sign out. There is also a settings page for choosing new categories.

**3.0 Features to be Tested**

Various features need to be tested for this sprint. Starting with we'll check if our news app is successfully obtaining recent news headlines from https://newsapi.org/. After that, we'll check that when the user is not signed in, he/she should be able to view news from the "General" category. When the user is signed in, the articles will be displayed from categories chosen in the user's settings.

We'll also check if there is signup, sign-in, settings, logout page, and a search bar for the users to search for specific topics.

**4.0 Approach**

The approach to test the features would be by using integration testing and documenting the test cases with the obtained test results. PHP, HTML, and JavaScript will be used for unit testing including the test-driven development test cases.

**5.0 Pass/Fail Criteria**

To check the pass/fail criteria, all the required features will be tested. If any feature or requirement is not meeting the criteria, then the test case will show as a fail otherwise it would be a pass. The pass/fail criteria will be determined once the unit testing has been performed.

**6.0 System Testing Tasks**

System testing entails testing the system as a whole. All modules/components are integrated to see if the system functions as planned. System testing comes after integration testing. This is critical in producing a high-quality product. We used to assess the finished and integrated system as a whole to see if it fits the criteria Before the product is sent into production, the functionality of the program is tested from beginning to end by a distinct testing team from the development team.

Regression testing:
Regression testing is a sort of testing that is used to ensure that a software update does not affect the product's existing functioning. This is to guarantee that the product functions properly with any new functionality, bug patches, or feature improvements. To check the impact of the modification, previously performed test cases are re-executed.

Here we would be testing all the modules of our website, such as our search bar, results in displaying regarding our search bar, complete entry login system, API, category tabs, favorite tab, pagination, and the news articles on an overall basis.

**8.0 Schedule**

Each testing assignment and test milestone has a specific timetable. We've listed the timeframes for each testing resource as well as the tools needed to execute them, such as the XAMPP server, MySQL, Apache, PHP files, and so on.

In our test plan and test results, we've included all test milestones from the sprint 4 plan, as well as all item transmittal events. We spent over 14 days getting the Entry system up and its operations.
